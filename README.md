## Inspiration For This Project
I am a certified emergency medical technician in the state of Pennsylvania and I am currently employed with Thomas Jefferson Univeristy Hospital as a critical care technican on the Cardiac/Coronary Step-down/Telementry/Intermediate Unit. I named this project after my home unit of 5West.  

During the height of the pandemic, most of our patients have been diagnosed with Covid, which is highly contagoous. Hospital protocols for covid patients were for patients to stay in their rooms and healthcare providers and workers had to properly gown up and wear protective gear. Most hospitals have patients ring the callbell if they needed any assistance and a nurse/aid/technician would come to the patient's room. For the most part, it was difficult to hear the patients over the callbell system and protective gear was scarce. We needed another way for our patients to contact us without risking infecting other people and or use up more protective gear to answer a call bell. 

Another inspiration for this project was to fight aganist alarm fatigue that all hospital workers are currently facing. In the hospital, monitor alarms, medical device alarms, bed alarms, chair alarms, and call bell alerts are always going off through out all hours of the day and night. Nurses and doctors  become alarm fatigued, so unfortunately, major events occur and patient outcome decrease over time. 

This project allows patients to input thier request in real time, when a hospital staff sees the request on the dashboard, they could either complete the request or delete it off the dashboard to mark that it was done. As a result, it will decrease the need for nurses to go into the patients room to hear the patient's request and also decreases the amount of alarms going off in the unit and therefore decrease alarm fatigue.

- I decided not to include user login and registration for this project for the following reasons: 
  - Patients would be move to different rooms multiple time during a hospital admission, pts would have to re-register the user's room and that could get confusing. 
  - Would have to have different set of users: Patients and Health Care Workers --> it made the project more complicated than it had to be. 
  - I wanted to make the project more user-friendly towards the elderly who aren't as tech savy.

I changed the original front-end design of this project because it looked too simple and plain. I decided to clone the design from Grove.co, I frequently visited because I really liked their design. Please visit them here --> https://www.grove.co/

#####Issues
The biggest issue I would love to fix in the distant future is to make this React Project more mobile friendly. I am currently taking some UX-design classes to make this better.
